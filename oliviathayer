In what ways does GitHub help scientists follow the best practices for scientific computing? 
GitHub helps scientists follow the best practices by allowing collaboration. GitHub allows people to work on projects together wihout having to be in the same vicinity.
Giving access to multiple people allows each person to contribute their share of work with the opportunity for others to check that work before adding it to the master branch.
In allowing for collaboration, this also helps to eliminate repitition because every member will be checking everyone elses work to make sure that the best, most updated version is added to the master branch.
Also, with every step in GitHub, there is room for details and explanation which ensures that each step a person takes is documented.
This allows for small steps to be taken one at a time by everyone working on a project together. 
In addition, each step requires new titles and descriptions, allowing for each step to be user friendly where everyone reading can follow along and be up to date on the latest changes.
